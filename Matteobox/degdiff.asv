function d = degdiff(d1,d2,halfcircleflag)
% DEGDIFF difference in degrees between two angles
%
% d = degdiff(d1,d2), where d1 and d2 are in degrees. Differences are
% between -180 and 180.
%
% d = degdiff(d1,d2,180), indicates that you want to be on the half circle
% (get answers between -90 and 90)
